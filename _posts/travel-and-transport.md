# Travel & Transport

## What airports should I fly into?

The closest airport is **Podgorica Airport (TGD)** — about 40 minutes from the venue.

**Tivat Airport (TIV)** is another option, about 1 hour 15 minutes away.

## Recommended flights from Stockholm Arlanda

### Friday 8 May

## Are airport transfers provided?

Yes! If you arrive on 8 or 9 May, we'll have a wedding shuttle from Podgorica Airport.

Look for a sign saying **"Moana and Gustav Wedding Shuttle."**

## What if I arrive on another day or at a different airport?

You can take a taxi or rent a car. Taxis from Sutomore to Talici Hill cost around €5–10 and take 8–10 minutes.

## Do I need to rent a car?

Not necessarily. We'll arrange shuttles on key days, and taxis are easy to book locally.

But if you'd like freedom to explore Montenegro before or after the wedding, a rental car is great. Options:

- **Tivat Airport:** Sixt
