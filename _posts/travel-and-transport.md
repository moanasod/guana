exampleQuestion: What airports should I fly into?
---


## "What airports should I fly into?"

The closest airport is **Podgorica Airport (TGD)** — about 40 minutes from the venue.

**Tivat Airport (TIV)** is another option, about 1 hour 15 minutes away.


## "Are airport transfers provided?"

Yes! If you arrive on 8 or 9 May, we'll have a wedding shuttle from Podgorica Airport.

Look for a sign saying **"Moana and Gustav Wedding Shuttle."**

## "What if I arrive on another day or at a different airport?"

You can take a taxi or rent a car. Taxis from Sutomore to Talići Hill cost around €5–10 and take 8–10 minutes.

## "Do I need to rent a car?"

Not necessarily. We'll arrange shuttles on key days, and taxis are easy to book locally.

But if you'd like freedom to explore Montenegro before or after the wedding, a rental car is great. Options:

- **Podgorica Airport:** MTL Rent a Car (family-run, airport pickup)
- **Tivat Airport:** Sixt
