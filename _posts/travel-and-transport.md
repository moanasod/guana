## Are airport transfers provided?

Yes. If you arrive on **8 or 9 May**, we'll have a wedding shuttle from Podgorica Airport. Look for a sign that says **"Moana and Gustav Wedding Shuttle."**

Tell the shuttle driver which hotel you have booked, and they will drive you directly there.

## What if I arrive on another day or at a different airport?

You can take a taxi or rent a car. Taxis from Sutomore to Talići Hill cost around **€10** and take 8–10 minutes.

---

## What's the taxi company number?

**Green Taxi** (serving Sutomore and Bar): **+382 69 888 801**

---

## Do I need to rent a car?

Not necessarily. We'll arrange shuttles on Friday and Saturday from the airport (for the suggested flights), and taxis are easy to book locally. But if you plan to explore Montenegro before or after the wedding weekend, renting a car is a great idea.

**Recommended car rentals:**

- **Podgorica Airport:** MTL Rent a Car (family-run, meets you at arrivals)
- **Tivat Airport:** Sixt
